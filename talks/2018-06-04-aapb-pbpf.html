# WGBH AAPB PBPF

class: center, middle

# training.ashleyblewer.com

This specific deck:  
bits.ashleyblewer.com/talks

---
# Plan 

- Length: 12:30 - 4:30  
- Stepping through different technical processes
- Hopefully very hands-on
- Breaks between coverage

---
# Covering today

- CLI
- Bash scripting
- checksum generating
- ffmpeg
- mediainfo
- mediaconch (bonus)
- qctools (bonus)

---
# TODO

- Ask questions! 
- Interrupt me!
- Ask each other!
- Help others!
- Don't worry about time -- we will probably cover everything, but it's better for us to go for depth into the earlier subjects rather than breadth of tools!
