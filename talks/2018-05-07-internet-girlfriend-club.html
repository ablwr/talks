- Here is a picture of my teen computer setup, which is sadly extremely similar to my life now. I saved up money from my job working at my dad's bingo parlor to buy a special video card that was able to digitize VHS tapes, and this is like, a big part of what I do for a living now, working in media preservation.

- I met a bunch of people and made a bunch of really close important friendships on the internet when I was this age, and this was also an age before it was cool to meet people on the internet. It was just.. weird.

- It was also a different internet, and this is what I want to talk about, and what I find so inspiring, and sort of a guidepost for how I want to live my life, and the web I want to support and live in

# "Mozilla Manifesto" [[link]](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/details/)

- The Internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
- The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.
- The Internet must enrich the lives of individual human beings.
- Individuals’ security and privacy on the Internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.
- Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
- The effectiveness of the Internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.
- Free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as a public resource.
- Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.
- Commercial involvement in the development of the Internet brings many benefits; a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.
- Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.

- so I made this web zine starting in earnest almost a year ago, to collect stories from this unique nascent time period, this precious early web, to try to articulate what I found so meaningful about this time (other than my own self-aggrandizing nostalgia)

- going to round up a few of my favorite zine submissions and talk about them and I hope they inspire you and the work that you do, presumably on or near the internet, until I run out of time
