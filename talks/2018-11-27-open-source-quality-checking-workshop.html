# Section 1: Quality Control

---
# Outline 

- Overview of quality control
- Overview of open source software
- A/V specific issues
- File validation nuances
- Technical specifications
- Standards process

---
# Why is quality control important?

If not fixed now, content can be partially lost.

- Tools to create video are available now, maybe not in the future
- Original analog carrier is available now, also maybe not in the future

---
# Why is quality control important?

- Quality issues are easier to catch now
- If discovered later, it might be too late

---
# Example site: A/VAA

.center[![](../assets/img/avaa.png)]

---
# Example site: "No time To Wait"

- free events focused on open media, open standards, and digital audiovisual preservation. Symposium program is made by archivists, who present how they work and the associated (open source) tools.

---
# Open Source

The four freedoms of open source (a.k.a. free software)

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others

---
# Other freedoms...

## You are not tied to any one vendor

- You decide the new features
- If you don‚Äôt like the product, you can change it
- For small project, usually one developer, you can fork if it does not go as you want
- For bigger projects, you may decide between different competitors for new development or support.

---
# Other freedoms...

- Free choice of (local) support/suppliers
- No black-box
- Common tools/codebase = larger userbase
- Less "forced" upgrades

---
# Common misconception

## Open source != no support

---
# Support models in open source

Financial:
- Support contracts
- Paid installation/integration
- Hire developers

Non-financial:
- Documentation
- Testing / bug-reports
- Helping others

---
# Support models in open source

There's even more support!

- From developers
- From you!

---
# Related OSS successes

- A real-world example: The lossless video codec FFV1
- Austrian National Archive (Mediathek) wanted to do lossless digital video archiving
- Not satisfied with existing products (Interoperability issues)
- Found FFV1 in FFmpeg: Excellent codec, but we wanted/needed more...
- Contacted and hired a FFV1 developer
- Other parties involved for advices (pooled resources)
- Budget calculated in reference to costs of proprietary alternatives
- Now FFV1 version 3: faster and integrity-aware
- Important: published our experiences with FFV1
- So: other archives using FFV1 now profit from improvements, too!

---
# Quality of software 

- Chicken and egg: if everyone waits, nothing happens
- We start with needs easy to handle and we create dedicated open source tools
- Tools become bigger, step by step, when more people join
- YOU can decide about participating in lowering the overall cost for archives.

---
# Benefits of paying

-  Better support/updates
-  Pooling resources
-  Designed for your use-cases
-  Overall better cost-effectiveness
-  Public money = public solution?

# Streams üåäüåäüåä

Video is made up of streams,
wrapped in a container,
and some of those streams are encoded with a codec

---
# Containers 

Containers hold the contents of a video file together. They also are responsible for identifying the data, how much of the data there is, what kind of data streams there are, time information, self-identification, and metadata about itself and its contents.

Containers also establish the appropriate file extension for the file.

A video file can only have one container but can (and probably do) contain multiple codecs.

# Some popular codecs (audio)

You'll see some repeats from the containers section. 

- AAC 
- FLAC 
- PCM (Uncompressed)
- MP3 
- Ogg 
- Opus

---
# Both?

I know, sometimes it can get confusing because the wrapper and the codec have the same name. Sometimes it's because they can only be used with each other.

For example, the Windows Media Player container can only contain the Windows Media Player codec. They are tied together in that way.

Other containers, especially open ones, do not care about the bitstream inside (or they care... less).

---
# Streams

- General/metadata
- Video
- Audio
- Subtitles/text
- Chapters

The extent and availability of the above is contingent on the parameters of the container in use.  

---
# Colorspaces

How is color organized, translated, conveyed, and presented?  

- RGB 
- YUV  
- YCbCr 
- YCoCg
- and more

---
# RGB 

Red, Green, Blue, like most modern computer monitors.
 
---
# YUV 

- Y = luma (brightness)
- U and V = chrominance (color)

U and V are **red-difference** and **blue-difference**

Sometimes people say YUV when they actually mean something else:

---
# YCbCr / YPbPr

- Y = luma (brightness)
- Cb and Cr = chrominance (color)

Cb and Cr are **blue-difference** and **red-difference**

YPbPr: Analog components... kindaaaaa

---
# YCoCg 

- Y = luma (brightness)
- Co and Cg = chrominance (color)

Co and Cg re **orange-difference** and **green-difference**

---
# Color bars 

.center[![mediainfo](../assets/img/smpte.png)]

(Questions?)

---
# Compression 

- Uncompressed: Data stream with no attempts to decrease size
- Compressed: Data is smushed in some way 
- Losslessly compressed: Data is smushed in some way, but can be un-smushed  
- Lossily Compressed: Data is smushed and this cannot be undone 

---
# Chroma subsampling 

A thing we do because human eyes can't really see color that well. Chroma subsampling is "the practice of encoding images by implementing less resolution for chroma information than for luma information."

Some common ones for preservation (because we want the best): 
- 4:4:4 (not actually subsampling)
- 4:2:2 (this is broadcast standard)
- 4:2:0 (also common in production)

Remember that in video, chroma is in both the Cb and Cr channels so each get subsampled.

---
# Chroma subsampling, explained 

What do these numbers mean? 

x:y:z  
x = width (horizontal) of sample size  
y = number of chroma samples in the first row  
z = number of chroma samples in the second row   

---
# Chroma subsampling, explained 

‚¨õÔ∏è = checked pixel  
‚¨úÔ∏è = ignored pixel  

- 4:4:4 is full chroma and not subsampling at all because everything is being sampled.  
‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è  
‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è  

- 4:2:2 is checking every other pixel horizontally and vertically  
‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è  
‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è 

- 4:2:0 is checking every other pixel horizontally but not vertically   
‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è ‚¨õÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è  
‚¨úÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è ‚¨úÔ∏è  

???

This is, of course, a simplification. Some algorithms (JPG?) don't just sample the first pixel, but sample both together and take the average results. So it's smarter than as basically outlined above.

# Standards 

- What is a technical standards process?
- What is the standardization process?
- What is a technical specification
- Why does it matter?

---
# Standards bodies 

- SMPTE 
- IETF 
- ISO

---
# Television display systems 

Good news, there are only three systems: 

- NTSC 
- PAL 
- SECAM 

Bad news, they are completely incompatible with each other.

---
# NTSC 

*National Television Standards Committee*  

Developed in the USA in 1954.

- Lines: 525
- Frame rate: 29.97 Hz
- Picture resolutions: 720x480; 704x480; 352x480; 352x240

---
# PAL 

*Phase Alternating Line*

Developed in 1967 by the United Kingdom & Germany.

- Lines: 625
- Frame rate: 25 Hz
- Picture resolution: 720x576; 704x576; 352x576; 352x288

---
# SECAM 

*S√©quentiel couleur √† m√©moire* ("Sequential colour with memory")

Developed in France in 1967. 

SECAM uses the same bandwidth and resolution (720x576) as PAL but transmits color differently.

# Pixels 

---
# Bit depth / Color depth

Pixel bit depth refers to color depth for each pixel, the amount of color information stored (as bits) in each and every pixel on screen.  

For perspective, 1-bit will have just two colors. Each pixel will have to answer a yes/no question for "Am I like this color?" and there is only one color to ask about. 2-bit allows for four colors.

8 bit = 256 colors  
10 bit = 1024 colors   
16 bit = 4,096 colors  
32 bit = 4,294,967,296 colors  

---
# Bit depth / Color depth

256 colors isn't very much. But video comes in as three components -- YCbCr or RGB, so it is running the bit depth over one pixel three times.

So when it's per channel, it means 8bit is 256x256x256

10bit is 1024x1024x1024.

Both of these numbers equate to way more colors than humans are capable of perceiving.

---
# Pixel Aspect Ratio

- PAR  
  The horizontal to vertical ratio of each, rectangular, physical pixel
- SAR  
  The horizontal to vertical ratio of solely the number of pixels in each direction
- DAR  
  The combination (which occurs by multiplication) of both the pixel aspect ratio and storage aspect ratio giving the aspect ratio as experienced by the viewer.

---
# Frame rates 

How fast do things go? 

- Pre-video rates
- 24
- 25 
- 29.97
- 48 
- and more 

---
# Aspect ratios 

- 4:3 (1.33:1) 	  SD
- 16:9 (1.77:1) 	HD
- 21:9 (2.35:1) 	Movies
- 19:10 (1.9:1) 	IMAX
- and more

Practice: [Beyonce game](https://ablwr.github.io/beyonce_quiz/)  

---
# Interlacing 

Interlacing is for optimizing perceived motion in lossy video. 

---
# TFF, BFF 

When interlacing, every other line is skipped. Which gets skipped depends on if the Scan Order is set to TFF or BFF. 

TFF = Top Field First (TFF)  
BFF = Bottom Field First (BFF)  

---
# De-interlacing 

MBAFF	Macroblock-Level Adaptive Frame/Field 
PAFF Picture Adaptive Frame Field


* PAFF allows to decide, on a frame basis, whether to encode each frame as a frame or as two fields. When encoded as two fields, it's as if you would have done a separatefields() on the frame.
* MBAFF allows to decide, on a macroblock basis, whether to encode as field or frame. Actually, it works on vertical pairs of macroblocks, so on 16x32 areas. You can easily put two frame macroblocks ( on under the other ), or two field ones ( one with the top lines, the other with the bottom lines ).

# Timecodes 

Timecodes assign a number to each frame.

BCD: Binary Coded Decimal (HH:MM:SS:FF)

BITC: Burnt-In Time Code  
LTC: Linear Timecode  
VITC: Vertical Interval Time Code  

---
# 3D and beyond?

- 3D 
- 360 video 
- Virtual reality
- all of the above???

---
# Standards 

These are some of the standards that we have to work with (and sometimes work around)!  

All of these standards make up the significant properties of video files and we have to abide by them and maintain them when we digitize or normalize.

---
# Technical specifications

- Open vs closed
- pros/cons for each
- Open: anyone can use, improve
- Closed: sometimes work is paid for? (but this is also typically true with open standards)

---
# What does this work look like?

# Validation 

So because of all of this, we can and should perform validation as a preservation practice:

- at acquisition
- when moving files
- upon ingest into preservation system
- regular checkups
