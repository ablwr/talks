# The four essential freedoms

A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms: [1]

- The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
- The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
- The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

As my colleague Jerome, who will be speaking in the early afternoon, put it eloquently yesterday -- the open source model of working flips the relationship between the vendor and the customers -- the customers make the decisions and the vendors follow suite, unlike in a traditional business model
